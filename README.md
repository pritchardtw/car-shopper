I've chose the facet filtering.

If you clone and run the repo there are a couple obvious
things missing I'd like to address.

1. This was my first Angular project ever. I had to take
a lot of time and go through the tutorials and read some
docs before I started this.

2. This could totally benefit from some CSS help. 
With time constraints in my personal life, I've opted to 
skip some of the CSS in hopes the angular development is more
important. 

3. I do not have a count on the filters to show how many 
cars there will be, as the filters are dependent on the
user input. If I did make it more like the proposed UI layout
this would totally make sense, but with time constraints I
went for a more rudimentary filtering system.

4. The dataset is obviously a bit radical in the sense that
it has things like '-1 mpg' for cars. This is clearly impossible
and instead of going through some data sanitization process I 
decided it would be fun if I just modified the filters to work
with the data set.


Thanks for taking the time to review my submission.
